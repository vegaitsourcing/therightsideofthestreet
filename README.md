# therightsideofthestreet
A website for the association “The right side of the street” Ulicni Trening / Prava Strana Ulice

The project goal is to allow people to have a website they can use to easily find parks for training and playing no matter where they are in Serbia, and to be able to see how to start training via videos that will be displayed on site. On top of that, this website should allow people to watch certain body type exercises and routines and educate themselves how to properly perform those exercises without getting hurt. Finally, the website should display all the parks and training zones across Serbia.
